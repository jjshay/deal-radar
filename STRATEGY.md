## Authentication Requirements

### Must Have COA From:
- **JSA** (James Spence Authentication)
- **PSA/DNA** (Professional Sports Authenticator)
- **BAS** (Beckett Authentication Services)

### Red Flags - Avoid:
- No COA or "COA included" without specifying company
- Price too good to be true (<50% market value)
- Stock photos instead of actual item
- New seller with no feedback
- Ships from China/overseas (likely fake)

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Buy Box
```
Target Buy Price = Market Value × 0.4 to 0.6
```

### Example:
- KAWS print sells for $800 average
- Target buy price: $320-$480
- After eBay fees (13%) and shipping: ~$250-400 profit

### Sell Strategy
1. **Price 10-15% below** highest comparable listing
2. **Best Offer enabled** - accept 85%+ of asking
3. **Free shipping** built into price (increases visibility)
4. **Auction for rare items** - can exceed market value

## Deal Scoring System

| Score | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 🔥 A+ | <40% market, verified COA, top artist | BUY IMMEDIATELY |
| ⭐ A | 40-50% market, has COA | Buy - great deal |
| ✓ B | 50-60% market, COA present | Buy - solid margin |
| ○ C | 60-70% market | Consider if rare item |
| ✗ D | >70% market | Skip - not enough margin |
